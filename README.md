# nix-crab

Declarative [h3adcr-b](https://github.com/Deadboy666/h3adcr-b/)-equivalent for NixOS.
Installs and wires up [SLSsteam](https://github.com/AceSLS/SLSsteam) (play unlocked/not-owned games),
[CloudRedirect](https://github.com/Selectively11/CloudRedirect) (cloud saves for non-owned/"lua" games)
and the optional [steamnetsock-patch](https://github.com/yesyes0649/steamnetsock-patch) (multiplayer fix),
plus a client-downgrade tool — all from a single flake.

On top of that base, two client-side stacks are available, and they are mutually exclusive:
[Millennium](#millennium-optional) for themes and plugins, or
[LuaTools](#luatools-slsteam-moon--lumen) via slsteam-moon + Lumen. Both want Steam's CEF debugging
endpoint.

## Features

- **SLSsteam** injected into the native Steam package via `LD_AUDIT` (`programs.steam` override) — no
  runtime patching of `steam.sh`.
- **CloudRedirect** installed as a Flatpak (declaratively via `nix-flatpak`) and injected with
  `LD_PRELOAD`.
- **netsock** (steamnetsock-patch) placed at `~/.config/SLSsteam/tools/netsock/netsock.so` for use as a
  per-game launch option.
- **CloudRedirect CLI** (`cloud_redirect_cli`) available on `PATH` and at
  `~/.local/share/CloudRedirect/cloud_redirect_lib`.
- **SteaMidra (SFF)** (optional) — .NET 9 AppImage for managing Steam accounts, tokens and configuration.
- **ACCELA** (optional) — Qt depot-downloader GUI from the Enter The Wired bundle, configured to hand
  its games to SLSsteam.
- **Millennium** (optional) — Steam client modding framework, applied as a `pkgs.steam` overlay so it
  stacks with the SLSsteam injection instead of fighting it. Plugins and themes install declaratively
  by store ID.
- **slsteam-moon + LuaTools** (optional) — the alternative injection: a SLSsteam fork with a native
  Lua manifest importer, built from source, plus Lumen and the LuaTools plugin under
  `~/.local/share/Lumen`. Replaces Millennium, not additive to it.
- **Client downgrade** (`nix-crab-downgrade`) — pins the Steam client to headcrab's compatible build
  using `dlm` + `dgsc` + `-overridepackageurl`.
- **`nix-crab-status`** — diagnostic command showing client version, SLSsteam config, netsock,
  CloudRedirect status (including which hook is wired up), the active injection fork and
  LuaTools/Lumen state. `--json` prints the same as machine-readable JSON.
- **`nix-crab-update`** — one-command maintenance: `nix flake update`, rebuild through
  `nh`/`nixos-rebuild` + `home-manager`, then prints the fresh `nix-crab-status`.
- **Zero-maintenance updates** — by default the Steam client is _not_ frozen: it follows updates on its
  own, and SLSsteam/CloudRedirect/netsock can be updated instantly by running `nix flake update` in your own configuration.

## Installation

Add the flake as an input:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nix-crab.url = "github:ItszFinn/nix-crab";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };
}
```

### NixOS module

```nix
modules = [
  nix-crab.nixosModules.default
  {
    programs.nix-crab.slssteam.enable = true;
    programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.enable = true;
    # programs.nix-crab.millennium.enable = true;  # optional
    # programs.nix-crab.downgrade.enable = true;   # optional
  }
];
```

### Home Manager module

```nix
modules = [
  nix-crab.homeModules.default
];
```

Both modules must be imported: the NixOS module injects SLSsteam/CloudRedirect into Steam, the home
module provides the SLSsteam config (`~/.config/SLSsteam/config.yaml`), netsock, the CloudRedirect
CLI and installs `org.cloudredirect.CloudRedirect` as a user Flatpak. Import both in one switch so
they stay in sync.

## Options

### `nixosModules.default`

| Option                                   | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `programs.nix-crab.slssteam.enable`      | Enable SLSsteam injection into the native Steam package. Implies `programs.steam.enable = true`.           |
| `programs.nix-crab.slssteam.extraEnv`    | Extra environment variables merged into the Steam override (used by CloudRedirect for `LD_PRELOAD`).       |
| `programs.nix-crab.slssteam-moon.enable` | Switch injection to [slsteam-moon](https://github.com/swwayps/slsteam-moon) (SLSsteam fork with a Lua manifest importer) instead of upstream SLSsteam. Takes precedence if both are enabled; built from source, so expect a 32-bit compile. |
| `programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.enable` | Enable CloudRedirect: enables the Flatpak service and sets `LD_PRELOAD` to the pinned `cloud_redirect.so`. |
| `programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.moon.enable` | Use the [cloudredirect-moon](https://github.com/swwayps/cloudredirect-moon) hook (scans `stplug-in`/`luaappids.yaml`) instead of upstream CloudRedirect. Opt-in, for the LuaTools stack. |
| `programs.nix-crab.millennium.enable`    | Replace `pkgs.steam` with `millennium-steam` via overlay. Combine with `slssteam.enable`.                   |
| `programs.nix-crab.downgrade.enable`     | Add the `nix-crab-downgrade` script to `environment.systemPackages`.                                       |
| `programs.nix-crab.downgrade.package`    | Override the wrapper script.                                                                               |

### `homeModules.default`

The home module imports the upstream typed `services.sls-steam.config` option (so every SLSsteam
setting is available with proper types) and sets headcrab-compatible defaults with `mkDefault`:
`PlayNotOwnedGames = true`, `DisableCloud = false`, plus the keys SLSsteam reads but the typed module
does not declare (`MaxSchemaTries`, `FakeName`, `DisableUpdates`, …) — without those it warns about
"Config loading errors" on every start. Those values only reach disk when
`slssteam.manageConfig = true`; by default the file is left to whoever else edits it. It also
configures:

- `services.flatpak` — remotes `flathub` + `cloudredirect`, package `org.cloudredirect.CloudRedirect`.
- `home.file` — netsock and the CloudRedirect CLI.
- `home.packages` — `cloud_redirect_cli` and `nix-crab-status`.

| Option                                    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `programs.nix-crab.slssteam.manageConfig` | Whether Nix manages `~/.config/SLSsteam/config.yaml` (default `false`, leaving the file unmanaged so external tools like SteaMidra can edit it). |
| `programs.nix-crab.steamidra.enable`      | Enable SteaMidra (SFF) desktop app (.NET 9 AppImage wrapper with desktop entry and icon).                                                        |
| `programs.nix-crab.accela.enable`         | Enable ACCELA desktop app (Enter The Wired AppImage with desktop entry, icon and a seeded `ACCELA.conf`).                                        |
| `programs.nix-crab.luatools.enable`       | Home side of the LuaTools stack: installs Lumen (backend) + the LuaTools plugin into `~/.local/share/Lumen`, provides a `lumen` command, and shadows `steam` with a wrapper that auto-starts Lumen when Steam launches. Requires `slssteam-moon.enable` on the NixOS side. |
| `programs.nix-crab.luatools.lumenService` | Run Lumen as a systemd user service (`nix-crab-lumen`, starts at login, `Restart=on-failure`) instead of the `steam`-wrapper sidecar; disables the `steam` shadow. Default `false`. |
| `programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.moon.enable` | Home side of the same switch: points `~/.local/share/CloudRedirect/cloud_redirect.so` at the moon hook so the app's status matches what is injected. Set it together with the NixOS option. |
| `programs.nix-crab.millennium.plugins`    | Millennium plugin IDs from [steambrew.app/plugins](https://steambrew.app/plugins); installed into `~/.local/share/millennium/plugins`.           |
| `programs.nix-crab.millennium.themes`     | Millennium themes from [steambrew.app/themes](https://steambrew.app/themes) by ID, name or repo; installed into `~/.steam/steam/millennium/themes`. |

## Updating

```
nix flake update
sudo nixos-rebuild switch   # or: home-manager switch
```

The `update flake lock` GitHub Actions workflow runs every Monday at 04:17 UTC and supports
manual dispatch. It refreshes all inputs with `nix flake update --refresh`, validates them with
`nix flake check --no-write-lock-file`, and commits the updated `flake.lock` directly to the
default branch. It makes no commit when the lock is unchanged. The workflow uses the repository's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` with permission to write contents; no extra secret is required.

Configurations consuming this fork still need to update their own `nix-crab` input to pick up
these commits.

That is all. SLSsteam, CloudRedirect, netsock and the CloudRedirect CLI all track their upstream
releases through the locked inputs. The Steam client updates itself on next launch.

> **Note:** If a Steam client update briefly breaks SLSsteam, the SLSsteam project usually fixes it
> quickly — the next `nix flake update` picks the fix up. `SafeMode` is not set by this flake;
> if you turn it on yourself, be aware it is meant for Steam Deck gamemode and can wrongly disable
> SLSsteam on desktop. `nix-crab-status` prints the value in effect.

## CloudRedirect app status

The app's "SLSsteam" row is a prerequisite check for the imperative h3adcr-b layout: it stats
`~/.local/share/SLSsteam/SLSsteam.so`. Nix keeps SLSsteam in the store, so the home module links it
to that path and grants the Flatpak `/nix/store:ro` (otherwise the symlink dangles inside the
sandbox) — the app then shows **"SLSsteam: Installed"**.

The CloudRedirect row works the same way: the app's deploy check stats
`~/.local/share/CloudRedirect/cloud_redirect.so` and otherwise reports **"failed to deploy"**. The
home module links that path to the pinned flake input — the same `.so` that
`modules/cloudredirect.nix` puts in `LD_PRELOAD`, so there is only ever one library.

What the app's own "deploy" would do beyond that — patching `steam.sh` — this flake does not need;
injection comes from `LD_PRELOAD`. Verify it with `DoInit: SUCCESS` in
`~/.config/CloudRedirect/cr_debug.log`. Don't press deploy in the app: the linked `.so` is
read-only in the store, so the app cannot write over it.

CloudRedirect only syncs if `DisableCloud: no` is set in `~/.config/SLSsteam/config.yaml`. Careful
with duplicate keys: SLSsteam's yaml-cpp lets the **last** occurrence win, and SteaMidra appends a
second flat key block to the file — so a `DisableCloud: no` at the top can be silently overridden by
a `DisableCloud: yes` further down. `nix-crab-status` reads the last occurrence and warns about
duplicates.

## Client downgrade (optional)

If you want to pin the Steam client to headcrab's compatible build instead of following updates:

```nix
programs.nix-crab.downgrade.enable = true;
```

Then run:

```
nix-crab-downgrade
```

This mirrors headcrab's flow: it writes the update-blocking `steam.cfg`, downloads the client
manifest, fetches the pinned client files with `dlm`, serves them with `dgsc` on `:1666` and applies
them via `steam -forcesteamupdate -forcepackagedownload -overridepackageurl http://localhost:1666/`.

> The downgrade is inherently pinned to a specific Steam build (`sources.txt`). Only use it if you
> explicitly want to freeze the client.

## netsock (multiplayer fix)

netsock fixes multiplayer in a few games that use SteamNetworkingSockets with SLSsteam's
`FakeAppIds`. It is **not** injected globally — set it as a **per-game launch option** in Steam:

```
LD_AUDIT="$HOME/.config/SLSsteam/tools/netsock/netsock.so" %command%
```

> **Never use netsock with anti-cheat games** — it scans and modifies game memory.

## nix-crab-status

```
nix-crab-status
```

Prints the Steam client version, SLSsteam config values, netsock presence, CloudRedirect status
(Flatpak + CLI), whether client updates are blocked, the injection fork observed in a running
Steam (`slsteam-moon` vs upstream SLSsteam) and the LuaTools/Lumen state (installed, plugin,
running, CEF endpoint attached). The CloudRedirect `Hook:` line reports which `cloud_redirect.so`
is wired up (upstream vs moon) by resolving the `~/.local/share` link — the same choice the
injection uses, so it shows what the game list scanner actually reads.

`--json` emits the same data as one JSON object:

```json
{
  "steam": {"version": "...", "manifest_note": "...", "updates_blocked": false},
  "slssteam": {"config_present": true, "disable_cloud": "no", "play_not_owned": "yes",
               "safe_mode": "no", "disable_cloud_duplicates": 2, "netsock_present": true},
  "injection": "slsteam-moon (LuaTools)",
  "games": {"stplug_in_dir": "/home/you/.steam/steam/config/stplug-in",
            "lua_manifests": 3, "luaappids_yaml": false},
  "cloudredirect": {"enabled": true, "hook": "moon (LuaTools)",
                    "cli_present": true, "flatpak_installed": true},
  "luatools": {"installed": true, "plugin_installed": true, "running": true, "cef_port": true}
}
```

`stplug_in_dir` and `manifest_note` are empty strings when not applicable.

## nix-crab-update

```
nix-crab-update
```

Runs `nix flake update` in the current directory, then switches with whatever is installed — `nh os
switch` + `nh home switch` if `nh` is on `PATH`, otherwise `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .`
plus `home-manager switch --flake .` — and finally prints `nix-crab-status` so you see the updated
versions in the same breath. Run it from your configuration repo (the one that imports
`nix-crab`); it exits before touching anything if there is no `flake.nix` in `$PWD`. It needs the
home module for the final status line; without it the rest still runs.

## SteaMidra (optional GUI)

If you want to use [SteaMidra (SFF)](https://github.com/Midrags/SFF) to manage Steam accounts, tokens and settings:

```nix
programs.nix-crab.steamidra.enable = true;
```

The release version comes from the `steamidra` flake input (GitHub's tag list), but the 520 MiB
AppImage is _not_ fetched by Nix: SFF has no versionless asset URL, so a Nix fetch would need a
hand-bumped SRI hash for every release. Instead the `steamidra` launcher downloads and unpacks
exactly the locked version into `~/.local/share/SteaMidra/` on first run (with a desktop
notification), then runs it through `appimage-run` with QtWebEngine sandboxing disabled. After
`nix flake update` the next launch picks up the new version. The desktop icon appears after that
first run. If you use SteaMidra alongside Nix-managed config, set `programs.nix-crab.slssteam.manageConfig = true;` or leave it unmanaged (`false`, the default) so SteaMidra can update `config.yaml` directly.

## Millennium (optional)

[Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium) adds themes and plugins to the Steam
client:

```nix
programs.nix-crab.millennium.enable = true;
```

It is applied as an overlay (`steam = millennium-steam`), not as `programs.steam.package` — that
option is already defined by the SLSsteam module, and a second definition is an eval error. As the
overlay only swaps the base package, `modules/slssteam.nix` keeps overriding it, and Millennium's own
`steam.nix` merges rather than replaces (`extraEnv // millenniumEnv`). The resulting Steam carries
`LD_AUDIT` (SLSsteam), `LD_PRELOAD` (CloudRedirect) and `MILLENNIUM_RUNTIME_PATH` at once.

Enable it together with `slssteam.enable`: on its own the module sets the package but not
`programs.steam.enable`, so nothing gets installed.

Two things to expect:

- **No binary cache.** Upstream publishes no substituter, so Millennium is compiled locally — about
  7 minutes for the 32- and 64-bit C++ trees on a 4-core laptop. The first build also pulls a large
  toolchain (rustc, gcc, cmake, bun) and the pinned second nixpkgs, so expect a few GB of downloads
  once; later rebuilds only recompile the three Millennium derivations.
- **The `millennium` input deliberately does not follow this flake's `nixpkgs`.** Upstream pins its
  own nixpkgs commit ("Bun FOD is sensitive to version changes"); following ours would rebuild
  Millennium on every `nix flake update` and risk breaking that fixed-output derivation. The cost is
  a second nixpkgs in the lock and a slightly older Steam wrapper version.

### Plugins and themes

Both are named by the `id` in their store URL — `https://steambrew.app/plugin/3dc714a7c1b1`,
`https://steambrew.app/theme/1wwKwvHrFuzMs7Kb1Uzu` (the store's card menu copies it for you). Themes
also accept their display name or GitHub repo name, whichever is at hand:

```nix
programs.nix-crab.millennium = {
  plugins = [ "3dc714a7c1b1" ];
  themes  = [ "1wwKwvHrFuzMs7Kb1Uzu" ];  # or "Adwaita"
};
```

On activation each entry is resolved against the store index (`/api/v1/plugins` for plugins,
`/api/v2` for themes) and unpacked where Millennium looks for it. Note that those are two different
places on Linux: plugins go to `~/.local/share/millennium/plugins` (its `MILLENNIUM__PLUGINS_PATH`),
themes to `~/.steam/steam/millennium/themes` (its internal `get_millennium_path()`). A stamp in
`~/.local/share/millennium/.nix-crab/` records what was installed, so later switches touch nothing and
hit no network unless you add an entry. Themes additionally get the `metadata.json` (owner, repo,
commit) that Millennium writes itself, so its updater knows what is on disk.

Installing is all this does. Enable the plugin, or pick the theme, once in Millennium's UI afterwards
— both live in a `config.json` that Millennium rewrites, so this flake stays out of it. Millennium
scans these folders at client startup, so restart Steam before looking for a fresh addon.

Take an entry out of the list and the next switch deletes its folder again. Only stamped addons are
touched, so whatever you installed yourself through Millennium's UI stays where it is. The active
theme is not reset — if you remove the theme you are currently using, pick another one in the UI.

Downloaded at activation, not with `fetchzip`: both stores serve an addon's newest commit, so a pinned
hash would break on every upstream release. They also land as real directories rather than store
symlinks, because Millennium writes into these folders.

### Risks and limits

Millennium loads by symlinking its bootstrap over `libXtst.so.6` in `~/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_*`.
It does not touch game processes, so it is irrelevant to VAC — but a Steam client update can break the
hook, and untrusted third-party plugins run unsandboxed with your user's rights. Millennium also cannot
be combined with the LuaTools stack (`slssteam-moon.enable` + `luatools.enable`) — both want Steam's
CEF debugging endpoint; see the LuaTools section below.

## LuaTools (slsteam-moon + Lumen)

Upstream's LuaTools Millennium plugin is end-of-support and its new app is Windows-only. The maintained
Linux path is the [slsteam-moon](https://github.com/swwayps/slsteam-moon) stack from the same maintainer:
a SLSsteam fork with a native Lua-manifest importer, plus [Lumen](https://github.com/swwayps/lumen) (a
static Lua backend) and the LuaTools plugin port.

Upstream SLSsteam stays the default. `slssteam-moon.enable` swaps the Steam injection to slsteam-moon
(which self-injects via `LD_AUDIT`, exactly like `slssteam.enable`):

```nix
programs.nix-crab.slssteam-moon.enable = true;
```

The LuaTools frontend is separate: the home-module `luatools.enable` installs Lumen + the plugin into
`~/.local/share/Lumen` and provides the `lumen` command. It does **not** switch the injection — set
`slssteam-moon.enable` on the NixOS side for that (Lumen's UI drives slsteam-moon's Lua manifest
importer, so upstream SLSsteam won't do):

```nix
# NixOS module — inject slsteam-moon instead of upstream SLSsteam:
programs.nix-crab.slssteam-moon.enable = true;
# NixOS module — cloud saves for LuaTools games need the moon hook (opt-in).
# `moon` only picks the variant; CloudRedirect itself still has to be enabled:
programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.enable = true;
programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.moon.enable = true;

# home module — installs Lumen + the plugin into ~/.local/share/Lumen:
programs.nix-crab.luatools.enable = true;
# home module — keep the CloudRedirect app status on the same hook:
programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.moon.enable = true;
```

Enabling `luatools` also touches `~/.steam/steam/.cef-enable-remote-debugging` on activation — Steam
only exposes the endpoint when that marker exists, and it is read at client startup, so restart Steam
after the first switch.

Lumen and the plugin are pinned by git rev, not the versionless `releases/latest` URLs (those change
content on every release and would break the lock's narHash).

With `luatools.enable` set, launching Steam starts Lumen automatically: the module shadows the
`steam` command with a wrapper that starts Steam, waits for slsteam-moon to publish its CEF
remote-debugging port to `~/.local/share/Lumen/cef_port` (a free loopback port, rewritten from
Steam's hard-coded 8080), then runs Lumen against it — the binary runs through `steam-run` on NixOS.
This covers both the `steam` command and Steam's desktop entry (both resolve the `steam` binary on
`PATH`). The `lumen` command remains for attaching Lumen to an already-running Steam. slsteam-moon
reads Lua manifests from `~/.steam/steam/config/stplug-in/`.

If you prefer Lumen as a managed service instead of the `steam`-wrapper sidecar, set
`programs.nix-crab.luatools.lumenService = true;` (home module). Lumen then starts at login under
`systemctl --user` (unit `nix-crab-lumen`, `Restart=on-failure`) and the `steam` command is
**not** shadowed — Steam launches plain and Lumen attaches on its own once the CEF port is
published. The default keeps the wrapper, which only runs Lumen while Steam is used; the two modes
are mutually exclusive by construction (the wrapper is dropped when the service is enabled).

> **Games do not land in `~/.config/SLSsteam/config.yaml`.** slsteam-moon deprecated the
> `AdditionalApps` section there — it is read only for backward compatibility. Added games are
> `<appid>.lua` files in `~/.steam/steam/config/stplug-in/` (the LuaTools plugin writes those), and
> manual additions go in `~/.config/SLSsteam/luaappids.yaml` as an `AdditionalApps` list. If you
> were checking `config.yaml` for your games, look at those two places instead — an empty
> `AdditionalApps` in `config.yaml` is expected, not a sign that the import failed.

> **Cloud saves for LuaTools games need the patched CloudRedirect hook — opt in.** Upstream
> `cloud_redirect.so` reads the game list only from `config.yaml`'s `AdditionalApps`, so it never
> sees stplug-in games. For the LuaTools stack, enable [cloudredirect-moon](https://github.com/swwayps/cloudredirect-moon),
> which additionally scans `stplug-in` and `luaappids.yaml` (set `programs.nix-crab.cloudredirect.moon.enable`
> in both modules). It still reads the legacy `config.yaml` list, so it also covers upstream
> SLSsteam — but it is opt-in and only needed for LuaTools; upstream CloudRedirect stays the default.

> **Do not combine with Millennium.** Lumen talks to Steam over the CEF remote-debugging **port**;
> Millennium grabs the same endpoint by launching `steamwebhelper` with `--remote-debugging-pipe`, so
> no TCP port exists, `~/.local/share/Lumen/cef_port` is never written, and Lumen cannot attach. The
> two stacks are mutually exclusive: either `millennium.enable` (themes/plugins) or
> `slssteam-moon.enable` + `luatools.enable` (LuaTools), not both. (The old LuaTools Millennium plugin
> is end-of-support anyway — this flake's LuaTools path is the maintained one.) If you see
> `--remote-debugging-pipe` on the `steamwebhelper` process, Millennium is holding the endpoint and
> LuaTools will not work.

## Caveats

- This is a _reimplementation_ of h3adcr-b for NixOS — not affiliated with h3adcr-b, SLSsteam or
  CloudRedirect.
- CloudRedirect is experimental by nature; back up saves you care about.
- Downloading and running third-party binaries (`dgsc`, `dlm`, `cloud_redirect_cli`) carries the same
  risk as h3adcr-b itself.
